This project that I have started, is part of my main project. Here at C-programming, I will teach how to program using C language. 
I am currently following this book: 
Computer Science(A structured programming approach using C) by Behrouz A. Forouzan & Richard F. Gilberg.

The way I will be conducting my website is quiet simple:
1. I will provide examples, and leave rest upto the reader.
As having "strong will" is one essential attribute for success. 
2. I will not dive too much in texts, but will definetly provide resources when possible or refer to appropriate books name, etc.
3. Most important, and most ambitious part of my website is to develop a system that can capture the user enter code and compile it and give you results on your end.(But as I said, this will take lot of time.)
4. I will teach you how to setup C compiler on your system, mostly preferred windows, as I do not own a Mac.

How to use my website resources:
Go through examples and retype them on your system, and run them and see where mistakes have occured. Or type them on provided website space(once the feature is made available). If you feel confident, then read the problem description and jump right into coding and test them with given testcases.

Please not, that the project is in its infact stage, and need lot of work. I am doing my best to speed up as fast I can, but being a Computer Engineering undergrad student I have other academic commitments too. Please be patient with me.
